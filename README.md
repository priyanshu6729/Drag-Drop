Drag-and-Drop Website Builder Prototype

🚀 Objective

The goal is to transform the existing form-based website builder on Websites.co.in into a more intuitive and flexible drag-and-drop interface. This will empower users to design and customize websites more freely while retaining the convenience of form-based element configuration.

📌 Context

Currently, Websites.co.in allows users to create websites by filling out forms, which generates a website using predefined templates. While this approach simplifies the process, it limits user control over design and layout. Introducing a drag-and-drop interface will:
✅ Improve design flexibility
✅ Enhance user engagement and satisfaction
✅ Maintain the existing form-based element configuration for ease of use

🎯 Task Overview

Create a prototype of a drag-and-drop website builder that combines the flexibility of drag-and-drop with the structured control of form-based customization.

🔥 Core Requirements

Drag-and-Drop Interface:

Users should be able to select elements (like text, images, buttons) from a side panel and drag them into a predefined template structure.

Smooth and responsive drag-and-drop interactions.

Snap-to-grid or alignment assistance for better element placement.

Form-Based Element Configuration:

After placing elements on the canvas, users should be able to open a form to modify properties such as:

Text content, font size, color, alignment

Image source, size, alt text

Button text, color, action (link)

Real-time preview of changes

Responsiveness:

Ensure the builder functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Allow users to preview and adjust their design for different screen sizes.

Scalability:

Design the builder with future expansion in mind:

Adding new templates

Adding new types of elements

Supporting third-party plugins/integrations

Code Quality:

Use React.js for the frontend.

Well-structured, clean, and maintainable code.

Follow modern development best practices (component-based architecture, state management).

🏗️ Technical Approach
🖥️ Frontend
Framework: React.js (Vite for fast development)

State Management: useContext or useReducer (Redux if needed for complex state)

Drag-and-Drop:

Use react-dnd or @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop functionality

Ensure smooth animations and interactions

Styling:

Use CSS Modules or Styled Components for scoped styling

Ensure consistent design with responsive media queries
